# excess_enthalpy_undergrad
The code for my final year research project predicting the excess enthalpy of binary mixtures using neural networks is held in this repository.

ExcessEnthalpywithoutSMILES is the code used to create a neural network that did not use SMILES vectors to predict the excess enthalpy of the mixture. 
ExcessEnthalpywithSMILES includes a function that encodes SMILES vectors for a component and uses that as an input to the neural network. This was the method I recommended as future research of this work and have found success with since then. 

I cannot add the real data used to this repository as it was data obtained from other author's, but I encourage you to read my report and test this on your own test data that is highly correlated.
